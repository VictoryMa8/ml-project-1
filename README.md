# ml-project-1

This is a repository for my 'Semester Project', which is for the course CSCI 200B: Machine Learning taught by Professor Kim Mandery at St. Olaf College. The content in the main file was originally from a separate Jupyter Notebook, which was modified to be a Python file for ease of access.
